# React Native Schedule View

This React Native component provides a scheduling view with space for unused time. Similar to Google Calendar's Day View.

## Installing

Installing is pretty simple:

```
npm install rnschedule
```

OR

```
yarn add rnschedule
```

## Example

```js
import React from 'react';
import RNSchedule from 'rnschedule';

const data = [
    {
      title: 'Lunch Appointment',
      subtitle: 'With Harry',
      start: new Date(2018, 11, 2, 13, 20),
      end: new Date(2018, 11, 2, 14, 20),
      color: '#390099',
    }
  ]

const App = () =>
  <RNSchedule
    data={data}
    onEventPress={(appt) => console.log(appt)}
  />

export default App
```

## Demo

## Contributing

I'm looking to add new contributors/maintainers to help out. So if you like this repo and want to help make it better let me know.

## To-Do List

The component is very much under-construction. Want to help build something? Here is my to-do list:

* Provide more control over Day Selector Styling.
* Work on speed optimization.
* Swipe to change days.
* Full Day appointments.
* Multi-Day appointments.
* Option for dots on days with appts.
* Events longer than 24 hours.
* Spec UI to Material Design.
* Build out testing.
* Contribution guidelines.
* Break out schedule view as stand-alone without cal select header.
* Fix Shadowing on Header - feels weird.

## Special Thanks

* Special thanks to Wix's RN Calendar for getting things started and providing inspiration.
